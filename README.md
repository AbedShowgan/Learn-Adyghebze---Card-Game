# Learn-Adyghebze---Card-Game
<span style="color:red"><b>NOTE:</b> </span>The app is currently in-progress. <br>
A fun way to learn Circassian Vocabulary using memory cards.<br>
This personal project has been created in order to help preserve the Circassian Language (Adyghebze) which is on the trajectory to be extinct.<br>
More and more people cease speaking it as their mother-tongue with the passage of time. <br>
My goal is to halt and reverse that trend, such that our people (and hopefully others) learn the language and start using it again. 
Wikipedia Source for the Circassian language: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassian_languages<br>
<u>The game is a card game where you have 2 sets of card:</u> <br>
<u>Red Cards: </u><br>
These cards represent the images for wehich we want to learn the word for.<br>
<u>Blue Cards:</u> <br>
These Represent the words written in Circassian that we want to match to each photo.<br>
If matched correctly, we score a point and the paired match disappears. <br>
Else, they get flipped over again and we are granted more tries.<br>
