# Learn-Adyghebze---Card-Game

**A fun way to learn Circassian Vocabulary using memory cards.** <br>

This Application has been created in order to help preserve the Circassian Language (Adyghebze) which is endangered as of today. <br>

Circassians since 21.5.1864 have been struggling to protect their language, and as a consequence many have forgotten it with the passage of time. <br>
This app aims to help Circassians ( and others) learn the language in an enjoyavble way <br>

<u>The game is a card game where you have 2 sets of card:</u> <br>
<u>**Red Cards:** </u><br>
These cards represent the images.<br>

<u>**Blue Cards:**  </u> <br>
These Represent the words written in Circassian that we want to match to each photo.<br>

If matched correctly, we score a point and the paired match disappears. <br>
Else, they get flipped over again and we are granted more tries.<br>
